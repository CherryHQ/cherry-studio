## 🔧 What Was Fixed Today

### 1. Settings Navigation Routing

**Problem**: Settings page sub-navigation was broken - clicking between settings sections (Provider → Model → General) would either create new tabs or fail to navigate properly.

**Root Cause**: Conflict between React Router navigation and the custom tab system. The `SettingsPage` was using React Router `<Link>` components that bypassed the tab system.

**Solution Applied** (from commit `9ce270c0c` on the old main):

- Added `updateTabRoute` action to the Redux tabs store
- Modified `SettingsPage` to use coordinated navigation:
  - Replaced `<Link>` components with `onClick` handlers
  - Added `navigateToSettings()` function that:
    - Updates tab route via `dispatch(updateTabRoute())`
    - Navigates with React Router
  - Fixed route paths to use full `/settings/*` format
  - Added default redirect route

**Files Modified**:

- `src/renderer/src/store/tabs.ts` - Added updateTabRoute action
- `src/renderer/src/pages/settings/SettingsPage.tsx` - Complete navigation rewrite
- `src/renderer/src/handler/NavigationHandler.tsx` - Fixed keyboard shortcut
- `src/renderer/src/components/TabBar/TabContentManager.tsx` - Removed conflicting route sync

### 2. Additional Fixes Applied

- Fixed singleton tab logic to properly handle sub-routes
- Updated navigation handler to use tab system instead of direct navigation
- Fixed ESLint warnings in TabContentManager

## 📁 Current Codebase State

### Working Features:

- ✅ Tab system with proper singleton handling
- ✅ Settings page navigation between all sub-sections
- ✅ Keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+,) for settings
- ✅ Proper route synchronization

### Removed/Avoided:

- ❌ All Firebase authentication code
- ❌ All Supabase integration
- ❌ Broken voice experiment code
- ❌ Related authentication components

### Project Structure:

- Using Electron + React + TypeScript
- Redux for state management
- React Router for routing (with custom tab system integration)
- Styled Components for styling

## ⚠️ Known Issues & TODO

### Immediate Attention:

1. **Inputbar Components** - Started fixing but not completed:
   - `WebSearchButton.tsx` - Partially updated
   - `MentionModelsButton.tsx` - Partially updated
   - `MCPToolsButton.tsx` - Needs update
   - These components still use direct `navigate()` calls that should use the tab system

2. **MCP Settings Navigation** - Multiple components in `src/renderer/src/pages/settings/MCPSettings/` use direct navigation

### Future Considerations:

- The git commit hook is checking for "PI verification" format - may want to configure or remove
- Consider cleaning up the backup branches once you're confident in the current state
- May need to communicate branch changes to team members before pushing

## 🚀 How to Continue

### To Resume Work:

```bash
# You're currently on main branch
git status  # Check current state
npm run dev  # Start development server
```

### To Test Settings Navigation:

1. Click Settings icon in sidebar
2. Navigate between Provider, Model, General, etc.
3. Verify same tab is reused and route updates

### To Complete Inputbar Fixes:

The pattern is to replace:

```typescript
// OLD
navigate('/settings/provider')

// NEW
dispatch(
  openTab({
    type: 'page',
    route: '/settings/provider',
    title: 'Settings - Provider',
    canClose: true,
    isPinned: false
  })
)
```

### To Push Changes (when ready):

```bash
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

⚠️ This will overwrite remote main with your clean version

## 💡 Key Learnings

1. **Always check forward git history** - The solution was already implemented in later commits
2. **Tab system + React Router** requires coordination, not competition
3. **updateTabRoute pattern** is the key to keeping them in sync
4. **Clean git history** is worth the effort - Firebase/Supabase mess is now isolated

## 📝 Session Notes

- Started with frustration about broken settings navigation
- Initially tried wrong approach (openTab for sub-navigation)
- Found correct solution in commit `9ce270c0c` from main branch
- Successfully extracted the good fixes while avoiding Firebase/Supabase code
- Created clean main branch from stable try1 state
