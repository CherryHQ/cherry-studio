# Fix MinAppPage Navigation Bar Cache Issue

## Summary
Fixes a critical bug where mini-app cache doesn't work when switching from sidebar navigation to top navigation mode.

## Problem Description
When users switch from sidebar navigation to top navigation mode, mini-apps opened in top navigation fail to cache properly. This occurs because `MinAppPage.tsx` uses `initialIsTopNavbar.current` (captured at component mount) instead of the real-time `isTopNavbar` value.

### Root Cause
- `initialIsTopNavbar.current` captures the navigation bar position when the component first mounts
- When users switch navigation modes, this ref remains unchanged
- This causes incorrect routing logic where top navigation mini-apps are redirected to popup mode instead of tab mode

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Start Cherry Studio in sidebar navigation mode
2. Switch to top navigation mode in settings
3. Open any mini-app from the top navigation
4. Observe that the mini-app doesn't cache properly (redirects to popup mode)

## Solution
- Replace `initialIsTopNavbar.current` with real-time `isTopNavbar` value
- Use `useState` instead of `useRef` for redirect tracking
- Reset redirect state when app ID or navigation mode changes
- Ensure proper cache integration for top navigation mode

## Changes Made
- Removed `initialIsTopNavbar` ref usage
- Replaced `hasRedirected` ref with `hasHandledRedirect` state
- Added state reset logic when app or navigation mode changes
- Updated all conditional logic to use real-time `isTopNavbar`
- Added `useState` import

## Testing
- ✅ Sidebar navigation mode works correctly (popup + cache)
- ✅ Top navigation mode works correctly (tab + cache)
- ✅ Switching from sidebar to top navigation now works
- ✅ Switching from top to sidebar navigation works
- ✅ Cache persists correctly across navigation mode changes
- ✅ No infinite redirect loops

## Impact
- Fixes mini-app cache functionality when switching navigation modes
- Improves user experience by ensuring consistent behavior
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
