# File Module Architecture

> **SoT scope** — **this document** owns: module boundaries, type system (`FileHandle` / `FileEntry` / `FileInfo`), IPC / DataApi contracts, layered architecture (no-FS-side-effect vs FS-side-effect paths), business-service integration, and service lifecycle assignment. FileManager **internal implementation** (storage layout, version detection, atomic writes, recycle bin, reference cleanup, watcher internals, orphan sweep, DanglingCache state machine) lives in [`file-manager-architecture.md`](./file-manager-architecture.md). In case of conflict, the layer ownership above decides: positioning / contract → this document, implementation → the other.
>
> **Phase note**: this document mixes two layers of truth:
> - **Current Phase 1a reality (`[1a ✅]`)** — DB schema, shared types, IPC/DataApi contracts, and design constraints that already exist in code
> - **Planned Phase 1b.x structure (`[1b.1]` / `[1b.2]` / `[1b.3]` / `[1b.4]`)** — the concrete `FileManager extends BaseService` lifecycle-service implementation and its `internal/*` execution layout, delivered incrementally per [RFC §9](../../../v2-refactor-temp/docs/file-manager/rfc-file-manager.md#九分阶段实施计划)
>
> When a section describes FileManager as a lifecycle service / facade class, read that as the **target implementation shape**, not as "already fully implemented in this phase". In the current phase, `src/main/file/FileManager.ts` is still contract-first: it exports the public type surface and JSDoc that the later lifecycle implementation must satisfy.

## 1. Module Scope

### 1.0 Core Principle

> **FileManager manages files introduced via explicit calls to `createInternalEntry` / `ensureExternalEntry`**—files exist as one of two origins: `internal` (Cherry owns the content) or `external` (records a path reference only). Which origin the caller chooses is a business-layer decision; FileManager makes no assumptions about it.

### 1.0.1 Semantics of Origin

The `origin` field on a FileEntry defines content ownership, with two values:

- **`internal`**: Cherry owns the file content, physically stored at `{userData}/files/{id}.{ext}`. The caller hands a Buffer/Stream/source file to FileManager, which copies and takes ownership. `name` / `ext` / `size` are authoritative on the row (atomic writes keep DB and FS in sync).
- **`external`**: Cherry only records an absolute path reference on the user's side, does not copy content, and does not own the file. `name` / `ext` on the row are pure projections of `externalPath` (basename / extname); `size` is **not stored** (always `null`) — live value is obtained via File IPC `getMetadata`. File availability and content changes are determined by the user side.

Which origin to pick is the **caller's** decision; FileManager makes no assumption about the business layer. For the specific caller's migration/current state, see the RFC.

### 1.0.2 Best-effort Semantics for External

An external entry is a persistent record that "the caller expressed the intent to reference this path at some point in time"—analogous to the "best-effort external reference" seen in tools like codex. It does not guarantee the file remains stable, nor that the content matches what it was when first referenced. Cherry does not actively mirror FS changes; instead, FS changes naturally surface as "reading new content next time" or "the entry turns dangling".

**Deferred implementation**:

- **`FileUploadService` + `file_upload` table + `FileUploadRepository`** — integrates with Vercel AI SDK's Files Upload API. The AI SDK API is still pre-release and its dependency is unstable, so this is deferred to a separate PR after the SDK reaches a stable version. The design is preserved in `file-manager-architecture.md §9` for reference.

### 1.2 FileManager's Position Within the Module

**Implementation-status note**: the bullets below describe the intended steady state once the lifecycle-backed FileManager lands. In Phase 1a, treat them as architectural commitments, not as a claim that the concrete `BaseService` subclass already exists in code.

FileManager is the core submodule of the file module, but is not equivalent to the file module as a whole.

- **FileManager** is the **sole public entry point** for the entry management system—responsible for the full lifecycle and content operations of FileEntry. Its public API only accepts `FileEntryId` / `FileHandle`. At startup, it performs an orphan sweep in the background (cleaning up leftover internal UUID files), **without blocking the ready signal**.
- **FileManager is a facade, not a God class** — business methods are delegated to private pure-function modules. The class itself owns only lifecycle, IPC registration, and instance-scoped caches. Implementation mechanics (dispatch helpers, deps passing, module layout, extension rules) live in [FileManager Architecture §1.6](./file-manager-architecture.md) — this document stays at the positioning layer.
- **DanglingCache** is a file_module singleton—maintains the `'present' | 'missing'` state of external entries, pushed by watcher events, with cold-path stat as a fallback, and served to the renderer via File IPC `getDanglingState` / `batchGetDanglingStates` (never DataApi).
- **DirectoryWatcher** is a generic FS primitive, **not a lifecycle service**; business modules (such as a future NoteService) new/dispose instances themselves via the `createDirectoryWatcher()` factory; the factory internally wires events into DanglingCache.
- **ops.ts** is on the same level as FileManager—provides pure FS/path operations that don't depend on the entry system, and is open to the entire main process.

#### Public / Private Boundaries

| Location | Visibility | Access |
|---|---|---|
| `FileManager` class + public types | **Entire main process** | **Today (Phase 1a):** import public types from `@main/file`. **Planned (Phase 1b+):** resolve the runtime instance via `application.get('FileManager')` once the lifecycle service is implemented |
| `ops/*` | **Entire main process** | `import { atomicWriteFile } from '@main/file/ops'` (BootConfig, MCP oauth, etc. can use directly) |
| `watcher/` (`createDirectoryWatcher` factory) | **Entire main process** | Business services call this when they need to watch external directories |
| `danglingCache` | **Internal to file-module** | External callers read it via File IPC `getDanglingState` / `batchGetDanglingStates`; never imported directly, never exposed via DataApi |
| `internal/*` | **Only FileManager** | All other locations (including `ops/` / `watcher/` within file-module) must not import it |

Boundary enforcement: `src/main/file/index.ts` barrel does not re-export `internal/*`; external `import from '@main/file'` cannot reach it. If violations are found during Phase 1b implementation, add an ESLint `no-restricted-imports` rule as a fallback.

### 1.3 Out of Scope

The following categories are **not** managed by the File Module (no FileEntry is produced):

| Category | Owner | Why it's not managed by FileManager |
|---|---|---|
| Notes file tree (files browsed/edited inside the Notes app) | Notes module (FS-first) | Notes has its own notes dir storage and external editor compatibility; the file tree is managed by the Notes domain and is **not mirrored wholesale into FileEntry**. |
| Knowledge base vector index | KnowledgeService | Auto-generated derived data, not a user file |
| MCP server configuration | MCP module | System/user configuration, not user-uploaded files |
| Preference / BootConfig | Config module | Application state |
| Log files | LoggerService | Auto-generated |
| Backup / export files | Corresponding business | Business-generated artifacts in transit |
| Agent workspace files | AgentService | Agent-produced at runtime |
| OCR / PDF pagination intermediates | Business module / `os.tmpdir` | Temporary computational artifacts |
| Real-time sync mirror of external directories | Business module assembles with DirectoryWatcher | File_module does not do bidirectional DB-FS sync |

**Note**: The table above is the boundary for "certain business data does not enter FileManager", not "certain file types don't enter". The same physical file can simultaneously belong to an FS-first business domain AND an external FileEntry (the latter is merely a reference to that path)—these are not mutually exclusive.

These modules manage their own files and may use `node:fs` or `ops/*` directly; they are not bound by the FileManager of the file module.

## 2. Type System: Reference vs Data Shape

### 2.1 Two Layers of File Types

The file module organizes its types along two layers — the **reference layer** (how a call site names the target file when crossing a boundary) and the **data-shape layer** (what the handler receives after resolving that reference):

```
                    Entry-referenced                   Path-referenced
                    ────────────────                   ────────────────
Reference layer     FileEntryHandle                    FilePathHandle
(across boundaries) { kind: 'entry', entryId }         { kind: 'path', path }
                          │                                  │
                          ▼ FileManager.getEntry             ▼ ops.stat + projection
Data-shape layer    FileEntry                          FileInfo
(after resolution)  { id, origin, name, ext,           { path, name, ext, size,
                      size, trashedAt, ... }             mime, type, modifiedAt, ... }
```

Picking a handle variant is a **call-site choice of reference form**, not a statement about the file itself. Crucially, **the two axes are orthogonal**:

- **Reference form** (this layer): `FileEntryHandle` routes through the entry system (FileManager, versionCache, DanglingCache updates); `FilePathHandle` bypasses it and hits `ops/*` directly.
- **Content ownership** (`FileEntry.origin`, not visible in the handle): `internal` means Cherry owns `{userData}/files/{id}.{ext}`; `external` means Cherry only records a reference to a user-owned path.

The **same physical external file** can therefore be reached by either handle variant. A `FileEntryHandle` to its entry goes through the entry-aware code path (dangling updates, version cache, identity-tracked operations); a `FilePathHandle` to the same absolute path goes through pure FS. Picking one is a matter of which subsystem the caller wants in the loop — not a property of the file.

### 2.2 `FileHandle`: the Polymorphic Reference

`FileHandle = FileEntryHandle | FilePathHandle` (see [`packages/shared/file/types/handle.ts`](../../../packages/shared/file/types/handle.ts)) is the first-class reference type crossing the IPC boundary. Every IPC method that makes sense regardless of which subsystem is in the loop accepts a `FileHandle`; handlers dispatch internally on `handle.kind`. See §3.3 for the full dispatch table.

Use `FileHandle` whenever a signature does not *inherently* require an entry row (e.g. anything that isn't a lifecycle op on a FileEntry).

### 2.3 `FileEntry` vs `FileInfo`

Once a handle is dispatched, the handler works with either a `FileEntry` (the DB row identified by an entryId) or a `FileInfo` (a live descriptor produced from a path). They are the two "data shapes" of a file:

| Aspect         | `FileEntry`                                                | `FileInfo`                                                |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Role           | DB row identified by `id`                                  | Live descriptor identified by `path`                      |
| Identity field | `id` (UUID v7)                                             | `path` (absolute filesystem path)                         |
| Liveness       | Persistent record — identity + stable projections only     | Live view — re-read from `fs.stat`                        |
| Lifecycle      | Persistent; trash/restore (internal-origin only)           | Transient — per-call descriptor                           |
| Produced by    | `createInternalEntry` / `ensureExternalEntry` / DataApi    | `ops.stat(path)` / `toFileInfo(entry)`                    |
| Typical use    | FileManager ops, UI management panels, `file_ref` creation | Pure content processors (OCR, hashing, tokenization)      |

**Field overlap is inherent, not redundant**: `name`, `ext`, `type` (and `mime` / `size` on `FileInfo`) describe a file regardless of whether an entry row exists for it. What distinguishes the two types is the *surrounding* fields and the *liveness* of the shared ones:

- **`FileEntry` has identity fields** `FileInfo` lacks: `id`, `origin`, `externalPath`, `trashedAt`.
- **`FileInfo` has live fields** `FileEntry` lacks: `path` (derived, never stored on `FileEntry`), `modifiedAt`, and a live `size`.
- **`FileEntry.size` is origin-gated**. For `origin='internal'` it is an authoritative byte count (kept in sync by atomic writes). For `origin='external'` it is **always `null`** — external files may change outside Cherry at any time, so no DB snapshot is stored. Consumers that need a live value for an external entry call File IPC `getMetadata(id)`, which runs `fs.stat` on demand. This eliminates the "is this snapshot current?" question at the type level rather than at call sites.
- **`FileEntry.name` / `FileEntry.ext` never drift**. For internal they are user-editable SoT; for external they are pure projections of `externalPath` (basename / extname) and therefore stable as long as the entry itself exists.

**Projection is one-way**. `FileEntry → FileInfo` is always possible via `toFileInfo(entry)` (async — performs `fs.stat` plus path resolution based on `origin`, which is also how the live `size` is materialized for external). The reverse is **not a type conversion**: it is a state change, and requires explicit registration through `FileManager.createInternalEntry` or `ensureExternalEntry`. The Zod brand on `FileEntrySchema` enforces this — arbitrary object literals cannot satisfy the `FileEntry` type.

### 2.4 Signature Selection Guide

Default to the narrowest type that covers the need. "When in doubt, `FileHandle`" for cross-boundary calls, and "when in doubt, `FileInfo`" for leaf content processors.

| What the consumer needs                                                                    | Signature                                |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Doesn't care which subsystem is in the loop; just operates on a file                       | `FileHandle` ⭐ default for IPC          |
| Only to call a FileManager lifecycle op (trash, restore, permanentDelete, …)               | `FileEntryId`                            |
| Only to hand a path to an ops-level FS function                                            | `FilePath`                               |
| The entry row's fields (UI management panel, origin-aware rendering, ref creation)         | `FileEntry`                              |
| A resolved on-disk descriptor for pure content processing                                  | `FileInfo` (typically a return type)     |

Anti-patterns to avoid:

- **Requiring `FileEntry` when only `path` or `size` is read** — this couples the caller to the entry system. Accept `FileHandle` (and dispatch), or accept `FileInfo` (and have the caller project).
- **Returning a value typed `FileEntry` whose contract is "might or might not be registered"** — use `FileHandle` or an explicit variant instead.
- **Synthesising a `FileEntry` from a `FileInfo`** — registration must go through sanctioned FileManager methods; the Zod brand is specifically there to prevent this.

### 2.5 Relationship to v1 `FileMetadata`

The legacy `FileMetadata` type served two roles simultaneously — DB persistence (Dexie `files` table, `message_block.file` JSON) **and** generic file descriptor (OCR input, token estimation, UI rendering). The v2 type system makes those roles explicit by splitting them:

- The **persistence role** → `FileEntry` (plus entry-system references via `file_ref`)
- The **descriptor role** → `FileInfo`
- The **polymorphic reference** → `FileHandle`

A consumer that was "given a `FileMetadata`" is migrated by asking *which role* it was using — see the [migration plan](../../../v2-refactor-temp/docs/file-manager/migration-plan.md) for per-consumer bucket assignment.

## 3. IPC Design

### 3.1 Design Motivation

The renderer needs a unified entry point for file operations (a single `read` can read both FileEntry and an external path), but inside the main process, entry management (DB + FS coordination) and pure path operations (FS directly) are two very different responsibilities.

Solution: **unified call entry + handler-level dispatch**. FileManager, as the sole IPC registrant, owns all handlers; each handler dispatches internally to different implementations based on target type.

### 3.2 Handler Dispatch

```
Renderer
  → FileManager.registerIpcHandlers() (unified entry)
    ├── target: FileEntryId → FileManager method (entry coordination: resolve → DB + FS)
    └── target: FilePath    → ops.ts (direct FS/path ops)
```

Other services in the main process can call ops.ts or FileManager directly as needed, without going through IPC.

### 3.3 IPC Method Categories

All operations that can act on any file (FileEntry or arbitrary path) **accept a `FileHandle` tagged union** (`{ kind: 'entry', entryId } | { kind: 'path', path }`). Handlers dispatch by `handle.kind` to FileManager (entry branch) or `ops/*` (path branch).

**Operations that accept FileHandle (entry + path branches unified)**:

| Method | Description | entry, internal-origin | entry, external-origin | path |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `read` | Read content | ops.read(userDataPath) | ops.read(externalPath) (live) | ops.read(path) |
| `getMetadata` | Live physical metadata (`fs.stat`) | resolve + ops.stat | ops.stat(externalPath) — **sole live-size source for external** | ops.stat + getFileType |
| `getVersion` | FileVersion (live `fs.stat`) | stat userData | stat externalPath | ops.statVersion |
| `getContentHash` | xxhash-128 | read userData + hash | read externalPath + hash | ops.contentHash |
| `write` | Atomic write | atomic → userData + DB size update | atomic → externalPath (explicit user edit; no DB size column to touch) | atomic → path |
| `writeIfUnchanged` | Optimistic concurrent write | same as write plus version check | same | same (caller must getVersion first) |
| `permanentDelete` | Delete entry | unlink userData + delete from DB | **delete from DB only** (physical file untouched; path-level deletion remains available via a `FilePathHandle` to `ops.remove`) | ops.remove(path) |
| `rename` | Rename | pure DB (UUID path unchanged) | fs.rename + DB update (name + externalPath) | ops.rename(path, newPath) |
| `copy` | Copy to a new internal-origin entry | read source + create new internal | read source external + create new internal | read path + create new internal |
| `open` / `showInFolder` | System ops | resolve + shell | resolve + shell | shell |

**Operations accepting only FileEntryId (meaningful only when you already hold an entry id)**:

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `createInternalEntry` / `batchCreateInternalEntries` | Create a new Cherry-owned FileEntry (writes to `{userData}/files/{id}.{ext}`; each call produces an independent new entry, no conflict possible) |
| `ensureExternalEntry` / `batchEnsureExternalEntries` | Pure upsert by `externalPath`—the entry point first `canonicalizeExternalPath(raw)` normalizes it (see `pathResolver.ts`); reuses the existing entry with the same path or inserts a new one. Idempotent by design—callers may safely repeat calls. No "restore" branch: external entries cannot be trashed. External rows carry no stored `size` (always `null`); live values come from `getMetadata`. |
| `trash` / `restore` | Soft delete based on trashedAt (DB only). **Internal-origin only** — external-origin entries cannot be trashed (`fe_external_no_trash` CHECK); passing an external id throws. |
| `batchTrash` / `batchRestore` | Batch versions of `trash` / `restore` — same internal-origin-only rule. |
| `batchPermanentDelete` | Batch version of `permanentDelete`. |
| `withTempCopy` | Copy isolation for calling third-party libraries |
| `getDanglingState` / `batchGetDanglingStates` | Query external-origin entry presence (FS-backed via DanglingCache; cold miss triggers a single `fs.stat`). Internal-origin entries always `'present'`. |
| `getPhysicalPath` / `batchGetPhysicalPaths` | Resolve absolute path for a FileEntry (main-side `resolvePhysicalPath`). Intended for agent context / drag-drop / subprocess spawn. Also the input to `toSafeFileUrl` for `<img src>` / `<video src>` rendering. |

**How to obtain dangling state / absolute path / live size**: these are FS-IO or main-side computation, so they live in File IPC — never DataApi. Dangling state via `getDanglingState`, path via `getPhysicalPath`, live `size` / `mtime` via `getMetadata`. DataApi's SQL-only boundary is documented in §4.1.1.

**How to obtain a `file://` URL for rendering**: compose it in-process from the `FilePath` returned by `getPhysicalPath`, using the shared pure helper `toSafeFileUrl(path, ext)` in `@shared/file/urlUtil` — no dedicated IPC needed. The helper applies the danger-file wrap (`.sh` / `.bat` / `.ps1` / `.exe` / `.app` etc. → containing directory URL) and does cross-platform `file://` encoding.

**Operations accepting only FilePath**:

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `select` | Electron file picker dialog |
| `save` | Electron save dialog + write file |
| `listDirectory` | Scan any directory contents |
| `isNotEmptyDir` | Check whether a directory is non-empty |

### 3.4 Operational Semantics for External Files

**Impact of Cherry's operations on external files**:

| User action | Physical external file |
|---|---|
| Trash from Cherry | **Not applicable** — external-origin entries cannot be trashed (`fe_external_no_trash` CHECK) |
| Restore from Cherry | **Not applicable** — external-origin entries are never trashed |
| permanentDelete from Cherry (entry-level) | **Untouched** — only the DB row is deleted; the physical file remains on disk |
| write / writeIfUnchanged from Cherry | **Overwritten** (atomic write) |
| Rename from Cherry | **Physically renamed** (the external filename also changes) |
| `ops.remove(path)` via `FilePathHandle` (path-level) | **Deleted** — this is a deliberate path-level operation, not coupled to any file_entry row |

**Key principles**:
- Cherry does not perform automatic / watcher-driven external file modifications
- Cherry does perform user-explicitly-requested external file modifications (save, rename)
- **Entry-level deletion (`permanentDelete` on an external file_entry) does NOT touch the physical file** — this decouples "remove from Cherry's tracking" from "destroy on disk". If a user truly wants to delete the physical file, they invoke the path-level `ops.remove(path)` (via a `FilePathHandle`) explicitly, which is not bound to any entry row.
- External entry lifecycle is monotonic (Active → Deleted), with no Trashed state — "remove entry from Cherry's view" always means clearing the DB row + cascading `file_ref` rows
- **Cherry does not track external file rename/move**—when a file is moved outside of Cherry, the corresponding entry becomes dangling (best-effort semantics); the caller must proactively call `ensureExternalEntry` on the new path to establish a new reference (upsert by path; reuses existing entry if hit)

Similar to VS Code's behavior model for open files: it changes when you tell it to, without modifying behind the scenes; if you change the file externally, it won't auto-follow.

### 3.5 AI SDK Integration (Deferred)

**AI SDK upload-related** → FileUploadService methods (**deferred implementation**, to be introduced after the AI SDK Files API is stable):

| Method                              | Description                      |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `ensureUploaded(entryId, provider)` | upload-if-needed                 |
| `buildProviderReference(entryId)`   | Build SharedV4ProviderReference  |
| `invalidate(entryId)`               | Clear cache (on content change)  |

## 4. Layered Architecture

### 4.1 No-FS-Side-Effect Path (DataApi)

FileEntryService / FileRefService are data repositories under `src/main/data/services/`, following the project's existing DataApi layered pattern. They **are not standalone lifecycle services**, but are exposed to the Renderer through the DataApiService bridge.

(`FileUploadRepository` is deferred along with FileUploadService.)

```
Renderer                              Main
+------------------+           +---------------------------------+
| useQuery()       |           | DataApiService (bridge)         |
| useMutation()    |--DataApi--+   |                             |
| (React hooks)    |           |   v                             |
+------------------+           | Handler (files.ts)              |
                               |   |                             |
                               |   v                             |
                               | FileEntryService (repository)   |
                               | FileRefService  (repository)    |
                               |   |                             |
                               |   v                             |
                               | DB (file_entry / file_ref)      |
                               +---------------------------------+
```

Services inside the main process may directly import and call the data repositories, without going through the DataApi handler.

DataApi endpoints (read-only, SQL-only, fixed-shape):

| Endpoint                         | Method | Purpose                                                                 |
| -------------------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/files/entries`                 | GET    | FileEntry list (supports origin / trashed / time-range filters). Fixed shape — no opt-in fields. |
| `/files/entries/:id`             | GET    | Single entry lookup. Fixed shape.                                       |
| `/files/entries/ref-counts`      | GET    | Ref-count aggregation for a batch of entry ids (pure SQL JOIN + GROUP BY). |
| `/files/entries/:id/refs`        | GET    | All references to a file.                                               |
| `/files/refs/by-source`          | GET    | All files referenced by a business object.                              |

> **DataApi vs File IPC decision criteria (strict boundary)**:
> - **DataApi** = **pure SQL read queries only**. Handlers MUST NOT touch FS, MUST NOT call main-side resolvers (`resolvePhysicalPath`), MUST NOT consult in-memory caches outside the DB (no `danglingCache.check`, no `versionCache`). The response shape is **fixed per endpoint — no opt-in flags that toggle extra fields**. SQL aggregations (JOIN / GROUP BY / COUNT) are the only allowed "derivation" because they remain DB-layer.
> - **File IPC** = everything else. All mutations (create / rename / delete / move / write / trash), **and** every read that needs FS IO or main-side computation (content read, dangling probe, path resolution, dialogs, streams, `open`).
>
> Rule of thumb: if a handler must call anything outside the Drizzle / `@db/*` surface to answer the request, it belongs in IPC. If two callers want the same data in different shapes, the answer is **two endpoints**, not one endpoint with a flag.

**List queries for external entries**: DataApi returns the DB row directly — identity (`id`, `origin`, `externalPath`), stable projections (`name`, `ext`), timestamps, `trashedAt`. External rows carry `size: null` by design (no snapshot stored). Consumers needing **live `size` / `mtime`** call File IPC `getMetadata(id)`; those needing only **whether the file currently exists** (dangling) call File IPC `getDanglingState` / `batchGetDanglingStates`.

### 4.1.1 DataApi Boundary: SQL-Only, Fixed Shape

DataApi handlers are strictly SQL-backed. A handler:

- MUST NOT read or `stat` the filesystem
- MUST NOT call main-side resolvers (`resolvePhysicalPath`, etc.)
- MUST NOT consult in-memory caches outside the DB (no `danglingCache.check`, no `versionCache`)
- MUST return a fixed shape per endpoint — **no opt-in flags** that toggle extra fields

The only allowed "derivation" inside DataApi is **SQL aggregation** (JOIN / GROUP BY / COUNT), because that stays in the DB layer.

**Where the former opt-in fields live now**:

| Former opt-in         | Current home                                                            | Kind                                             |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `includeRefCount`     | DataApi `GET /files/entries/ref-counts?entryIds=...` — dedicated endpoint | Pure SQL aggregation (JOIN + GROUP BY)           |
| `includeDangling`     | File IPC `getDanglingState` / `batchGetDanglingStates`                  | FS-backed (DanglingCache + cold-path `fs.stat`)  |
| `includePath`         | File IPC `getPhysicalPath` / `batchGetPhysicalPaths`                    | Main-side path resolution                        |
| `includeUrl`          | Shared pure helper `toSafeFileUrl(path, ext)` (`@shared/file/urlUtil`), composed in-process from the `FilePath` returned by `getPhysicalPath` | Pure formatting + danger-file wrap (no IPC of its own) |
| Live `size` / `mtime` for external | File IPC `getMetadata(id)`                                   | FS-backed (`fs.stat`) — external rows have `size: null` in DB by design |

**Why this split**: DataApi's value is a predictable, cache-friendly, SQL-level surface. Once a handler can reach past the DB, every consumer inherits hidden IO costs whether they asked for them or not, and React Query cache keys stop being a reliable freshness boundary. Moving FS / compute side effects to File IPC makes the cost visible at the call site and keeps DataApi endpoints cache-safe.

**Composition in the renderer**: fetch the entry list via DataApi, then call the relevant batch IPC method(s) with the retrieved ids. Wrap the two-step pattern in a dedicated hook (e.g. `useEntriesWithPresence`) so components stay declarative.

**Staleness contract for dangling (best-effort)**: `dangling` is an FS-observed time-varying value — the watcher may not cover every path, and a file may be externally deleted right after a cache hit. Consumers of `getDanglingState` / `batchGetDanglingStates` MUST allow a natural refresh lifecycle (React Query `staleTime` ≤ 5min, or explicit refetch after a user action). **Do not** cache the result with `staleTime: Infinity` — that equates to the contradictory "I want dangling but refuse to re-check". For user-triggered refresh, invalidate the presence query (the refetch re-runs the IPC, which repopulates the cache via a cold `fs.stat`).

**Safety conventions for raw path / URL (carried over from the opt-in era, still relevant)**:

- **`getPhysicalPath` — NOT intended for**: caching as a stable identifier (storage layout may change); string-concat into shell commands without independent sanitization; bypassing FileManager for writes. Use `entry.id` when identity is all you need.
- **`toSafeFileUrl` — scoped capability**: the danger-file wrap defends only HTML rendering contexts (`<img src>` / `<video src>` / `<embed>`), not arbitrary string concatenation. Don't compose this URL into command-line args or subprocess arguments — pass the raw `FilePath` from `getPhysicalPath` instead.
- Both are bound **by convention**; the type system cannot prevent misuse of a `string`. Code review should verify each call site against the intended uses listed here.

### 4.1.1.1 Main Is SoT for Path Resolution

"Main as SoT for path resolution" means **authority (who defines the resolution rule)** — `resolvePhysicalPath` decides how `id + ext` are concatenated, where `userData` lives, whether the layout becomes hash-bucketed in the future, etc. The renderer consumes the string values produced by Main (via File IPC `getPhysicalPath`), but does not share authority:

- When storage layout iterates on the Main side, renderer code needs zero changes
- The renderer **holds** the string value (locality), but does not **define** the computation rules (authority)

The spread of **locality** (a path string arriving in the renderer via IPC) is not the spread of **authority** (ownership of the resolution rule). The former is a natural consumption relationship; only the latter would actually tear the SoT apart.

Pure **formatting** helpers built on top of an already-resolved path — `toFileUrl` (cross-platform `file://` encoding), `isDangerExt` (HTML-render danger policy), `toSafeFileUrl` (the composition used for `<img src>`) — live in the shared `@shared/file/urlUtil` module and run in whichever process needs them. They consume Main's authoritative path string but carry no authority themselves; storage-layout changes in Main still don't affect them.

### 4.1.2 Typical Renderer Call Flows

The new pattern is **DataApi for SQL-level data + File IPC for enrichments**, composed in the renderer. Each extra enrichment = one more `useQuery` against an IPC method.

```typescript
// Case 1: FilesPage — list + presence + preview URL + ref counts
//         (external rows also need getMetadata for live size)
const { data: entries } = useQuery(fileApi.listEntries, {})
const entryIds = entries?.map(e => e.id) ?? []
const externalIds = entries?.filter(e => e.origin === 'external').map(e => e.id) ?? []

const { data: presence } = useQuery(
  ['fileManager.batchGetDanglingStates', entryIds],
  () => window.api.fileManager.batchGetDanglingStates(entryIds),
  { enabled: entryIds.length > 0 }
)
const { data: paths } = useQuery(
  ['fileManager.batchGetPhysicalPaths', entryIds],
  () => window.api.fileManager.batchGetPhysicalPaths(entryIds),
  { enabled: entryIds.length > 0 }
)
const { data: liveMeta } = useQuery(
  ['fileManager.getMetadata', externalIds],
  async () => {
    const pairs = await Promise.all(
      externalIds.map(async (id) => [id, await window.api.fileManager.getMetadata({ kind: 'entry', entryId: id })] as const)
    )
    return Object.fromEntries(pairs)
  },
  { enabled: externalIds.length > 0 } // internal.size is already on the DataApi row
)
const { data: refCounts } = useQuery(fileApi.refCounts, { entryIds })
// size lookup: prefer DB (internal SoT), fall back to live stat (external):
//   const size = entry.size ?? liveMeta?.[entry.id]?.size
// render (URL computed in-process — no extra IPC):
//   <img src={paths && toSafeFileUrl(paths[entry.id], entry.ext)} />
//   dangling: presence?.[entry.id], count: refCounts?.[entry.id]

// Case 2: Agent compose — list + absolute paths (same IPC as above, different consumer)
const { data: entries } = useQuery(fileApi.listEntries, { ids: selectedFileIds })
const { data: paths } = useQuery(
  ['fileManager.batchGetPhysicalPaths', selectedFileIds],
  () => window.api.fileManager.batchGetPhysicalPaths(selectedFileIds)
)
const filePaths = selectedFileIds.map(id => paths?.[id]).filter(Boolean).join('\n')

// Case 3: Simple chat attachment list — no enrichment needed
const { data: entries } = useQuery(fileApi.listEntries, { origin: 'internal' })
```

Benefits of the split:

- **DataApi is predictable**: one SQL query per endpoint, deterministic cost, cache-friendly
- **Enrichment cost is explicit** at the call site — every FS/compute hop has a visible `useQuery` next to it
- **Mutations uniformly go through IPC**, cleanly separating "view data" from "change data"
- **Renderer is unaware of internal storage layout**; main-side storage changes don't propagate

For patterns that recur across components, encapsulate the composition in a hook (e.g. `useEntriesWithPresence(filter)`) so callers stay declarative without re-introducing opt-in flags.

### 4.2 FS-Side-Effect Path (File IPC)

All FS-involving operations go through dedicated IPC channels and **do not go through DataApi**.

```

| .createInternalEntry() |           |   +-- entry ops ----+                |
| .read()       |           |   |  (resolve entryId → filePath,    |

| .select()     |           |   |   + ops.ts pure functions)       |
| .open()  ...  |           |   |                                  |
|               |           |   +-- path ops ---> ops.ts           |
|               |           |   |                 (sole FS owner)  |

| Layer                    | Type            | Touches DB     | Touches FS              | Touches Electron API      | Exposed to Renderer |
| ------------------------ | --------------- | -------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **FileManager**          | lifecycle       | via repository | **No (via ops.ts)**     | dialog                    | Yes (IPC)           |
| **DanglingCache**        | singleton       | read-only once at startup | No (cache only; fs via ops) | No                 | Indirect (via DataApi) |
| **DirectoryWatcher**     | primitive class | No             | Indirect (chokidar)     | No                        | No (used by business modules) |
| **ops.ts**               | pure functions  | No             | **Yes (sole FS owner)** | shell (open/showInFolder) | No                  |
| **FileEntryService**     | data repository | Yes (direct)   | No                      | No                        | Yes (via DataApi)   |
| **FileRefService**       | data repository | Yes (direct)   | No                      | No                        | Yes (via DataApi)   |

**Core principles**:

- **ops.ts is the only module that directly `import node:fs`**—all FS operations go through it. Modules outside file_module (BootConfig, MCP oauth, etc.) may import primitives like `atomicWriteFile`
- **FileManager is the sole entry point for entry operations**—registers IPC handlers, resolves entryId → filePath, coordinates DB (via repository) + FS (via ops.ts)
- **The Renderer never operates on the FS directly**; all FS operations are delegated to Main via IPC

```

**Key data flows**:

- **Renderer → Main (read, SQL-backed data)**: DataApi → Handler → FileEntryService → DB (pure SQL; no FS, no resolvers)
- **Renderer → Main (read, FS / compute-backed enrichment)**: File IPC → FileManager → DanglingCache / resolvePhysicalPath (side effects allowed). `file://` URL composition happens in-process on top of the returned path via the shared `toSafeFileUrl` helper — no dedicated IPC.
- **Renderer → Main (write)**: IPC → FileManager (coordinates DB + ops.ts)
- **Business Service → file data**: pure DB operations call data repositories directly; FS-involving operations go through FileManager
- **External directory monitoring**: business services create instances via the `createDirectoryWatcher()` factory and subscribe to the events they care about; the factory internally injects events into DanglingCache (business unaware)

### 5.2 Touchpoints for Business Services

Business services interact with the file module through three channels:

- **No-FS-side-effect operations** (entry queries, reference management) → import data repositories directly (`fileEntrySafe` / `fileRefService`)
- **FS-involving operations** (read/write file content, create/delete entry) → **FileManager**
- **External directory monitoring** (if needed) → call the `createDirectoryWatcher()` factory (provided by file_module); the factory auto-wires events into DanglingCache; the business only subscribes to events it cares about

#### (1) On Business Creation — Create a FileRef

When a business operation produces a file reference, call `fileRefService.create()` directly. The Renderer does not create refs directly.

The specific values of `sourceType` / `role` are defined by each business module and uniformly registered when the `SourceTypeChecker` is registered (Layer 3 orphan scanning depends on this registration—enforced at compile time).

#### (2) On Business Deletion — Cleanup FileRef

When a business object is deleted, **you must** actively clean up the associated file_ref:

```typescript
// Single
await fileRefService.cleanupBySource(sourceType, sourceId)
// Batch (e.g., deleting a parent object cascades the refs of all its children)
await fileRefService.cleanupBySourceBatch(sourceType, sourceIds)
```

Each business module calls this inside its own delete flow. Any ref that goes uncleaned is caught by Layer 3 orphan scanning.

#### (2b) Developer Checklist for Adding a New sourceType

To avoid the governance pitfall of "added a sourceType but forgot to wire up some step", follow the order below when adding a new variant (every step is required):

| Step | Location | Action | Enforcement |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `packages/shared/data/types/file/ref/<name>.ts` | Create the variant file: declare `xxxSourceType` / `xxxRoles` / `xxxRefFields` + `xxxFileRefSchema = createRefSchema(...)` | Code review |
| 2 | `packages/shared/data/types/file/ref/index.ts` | Add the variant to `allSourceTypes` (type aggregation) + `FileRefSchema` discriminated union | Type system narrow failure |
| 3 | `src/main/data/services/orphan/FileRefCheckerRegistry.ts` | Add a checker in `Record<FileRefSourceType, SourceTypeChecker>` | **Compile-time enforced** (missing Record key → TS error) |
| 4 | Business service (delete flow) | Call `fileRefService.cleanupBySource(sourceType, id)` when the object is deleted | Code review + unit tests + step 3 as fallback |

**Design intent**: push-and-pull complement each other—

- **Pull** (step 4): the business service cleans it up itself in its delete flow—this is the preferred path and avoids ref buildup
- **Push** (step 3): OrphanRefScanner acts as a safety net, periodically scanning `file_ref` to find rows with non-existent sourceIds and removing them. **Compile-time Record closure** ensures no sourceType is missed.
- **There is no per-sourceType `onSourceDeleted` hook**: the cleanup logic of `cleanupBySource` is identical across all sourceTypes (delete rows matching `(sourceType, sourceId)`). Business-specific cleanup (e.g., rebuilding vectors when a knowledge base is deleted) belongs to the business service's own delete flow and should not be coupled to the ref system.

Reference implementation (Phase 1b provides tempSession as a template):

```typescript
// src/main/data/services/orphan/FileRefCheckerRegistry.ts
// Compile-time enforcement: every FileRefSourceType has a checker; missing keys trigger a TypeScript error
export const fileRefCheckers: Record<FileRefSourceType, SourceTypeChecker> = {
  temp_session: {
    sourceType: 'temp_session',
    checkExists: async () => new Set()  // temp has no persistent source; treat everything as "deleted"
  },
  // If you miss a key here after adding a new sourceType, TypeScript fails to compile
}
```

#### (3) Ways Business Services Access Files

```
BusinessService
    |
    +-- direct import (no FS side effect)
    |   +-- fileEntrySafe.getById(entryId)          -> FileEntry
    |   +-- fileEntrySafe.list(filter)              -> FileEntry[]
    |   +-- fileRefService.create(dto)              -> FileRef
    |   +-- fileRefService.cleanupBySource(...)     -> void
    |
    +-- via FileManager (has FS side effect)
    |   +-- read(entryId, opts?)                    -> ReadResult
    |   +-- write(entryId, data)                    -> FileVersion  [internal only]
    |   +-- writeIfUnchanged(entryId, data, ver)    -> FileVersion  [internal only]
    |   +-- withTempCopy(entryId, fn)               -> T            [for 3rd-party libs]
    |
    +-- fileModule.createDirectoryWatcher(opts) (optional)
    |   +-- for monitoring external directories (NoteService etc. business)
    |   +-- factory auto-wires events into DanglingCache
    |
    x-- fs.readFile / writeFile / unlink           -> FORBIDDEN for FileEntry paths
    x-- ops/fs direct on FileEntry-backed paths    -> FORBIDDEN (same reason)
```

**Why business services are forbidden from directly operating on the physical files backing a FileEntry**:

- **Path opacity**: the physical path is determined by origin (internal = UUID-based; external = user-provided); business services must not assume it
- **Cache consistency**: FileManager maintains an in-memory version cache; bypassing it causes inconsistency
- **Atomicity guarantee**: writes must go through FileManager's atomic write path

The scope of this constraint is **physical files backing a FileEntry**. Other modules' own files (Knowledge vector index, Agent workspace, MCP config, Notes, etc.) are outside this constraint.

### 5.3 Exposure Principles for Path Operations

`resolvePhysicalPath` **is not exposed externally**. Business services obtain file content via two channels:

1. **Buffer / Stream**: `FileManager.read` / `createReadStream` — the majority of cases
2. **Temporary copy**: `FileManager.withTempCopy(id, fn)` — for third-party libraries that only accept a path (sharp / pdf-lib / officeparser, etc.)

This guarantees that writes necessarily go through FileManager (no write-path escape at the type-system level), while providing an escape hatch for third-party libraries that strictly require a path.

**Future**: AI SDK uploads will be wrapped by a standalone `FileUploadService.ensureUploaded` combining read + upload (to be introduced after the AI SDK Files API is stable).

## 6. Service Lifecycle

### 6.1 Startup Phase Assignment

```
Lifecycle Services:

BeforeReady (parallel with app.whenReady(), no Electron API)
+-- DbService                    -- database connection

WhenReady (after app.whenReady(), Electron API available)
+-- FileManager                  -- entry coordination + IPC
      @DependsOn(DbService)
      onInit(): registers IPC, inits LRU cache, inits DanglingCache reverse
                index from DB, FIRES background orphan sweep
                (sweep runs async; does NOT block ready)

Background (fire-and-forget, non-blocking)
+-- OrphanRefScanner             -- delayed 30s, scan orphan refs
+-- FileManager.runOrphanSweep   -- started in onInit, cleans internal UUID
                                    files not in DB + *.tmp-<uuid> residues

Singletons / Primitives (no lifecycle):
+-- ops.ts                        -- sole FS owner, stateless
+-- DanglingCache                 -- file_module singleton, populated lazily
+-- DirectoryWatcher              -- consumable class, created via factory

Data Repositories (not lifecycle, managed by DataApiService):
+-- FileEntryService              -- entry CRUD (pure DB)
+-- FileRefService                -- ref CRUD (pure DB)
```

**Deferred introduction (after AI SDK is stable)**:

- `FileUploadService` (lifecycle service) + `FileUploadRepository`

### 6.2 Startup Timeline

```
                     BeforeReady
                          |
                      DbService
                          |
                     app.whenReady()
                          |
                          v     WhenReady
                     FileManager.onInit():
                       1. register IPC handlers
                       2. initialize version cache LRU
                       3. init DanglingCache reverse index from DB
                          (SELECT id, externalPath FROM file_entry
                           WHERE origin='external'
                           — external rows are never trashed by invariant)
                       4. fire void this.runOrphanSweep()  ◄── not awaited
                                   │
                          (ready signal emitted immediately; ready not blocked)
                          │                            │
                          ▼                            ▼
                      onAllReady()                 (background in parallel)
                          │                   orphan sweep:
                          ▼                     UUID files not in DB → unlink
                 OrphanRefScanner.start          *.tmp-<uuidv7> → unlink
                 (delayed 30s)
```

**Key**: `runOrphanSweep()` starts with `void` rather than `await`, so `onInit` returns immediately and the service becomes ready immediately. DanglingCache reverse index initialization is a **synchronous DB query** that should be fast (external entries are usually <10000 rows), so no additional signal mechanism is introduced.

### 6.3 Dependency Declarations for Business Services

Any business service that consumes FileManager needs `@DependsOn(FileManager)`:

```
<AnyBusinessService>
  @DependsOn(FileManager)
  +-- queries entries via fileEntrySafe (no FS side effect)
  +-- creates/cleans refs via fileRefService (pure DB)
  +-- reads file content via FileManager (FS)
  +-- (optional) owns DirectoryWatcher instances via the factory
```

Specific services and their dependency declarations are registered by each business module in `serviceRegistry.ts`.

## 8. Constraints and Limitations

- **External entry is a best-effort reference**: no guarantee the file remains stable, no guarantee content matches the reference-time content. Equivalent to "the user expressed intent to reference this path at some point" semantics in tools like codex
- **External entry path is globally unique**: at most one row per `externalPath` at any time, regardless of any state (SQLite global unique index on `externalPath`; internal rows have `externalPath = null` and are exempt, since SQLite treats multiple NULLs as distinct). `ensureExternalEntry` is therefore a pure upsert by path — reuse if an entry exists, otherwise insert; no "restore" branch is possible because external entries cannot be trashed.
- **External entries cannot be trashed**: enforced at the DB layer by `CHECK (origin != 'external' OR trashedAt IS NULL)` (`fe_external_no_trash`). External lifecycle is monotonic: create via `ensureExternalEntry` → update in place via `write` / `rename` → remove via `permanentDelete` (DB row only). There is no soft-delete / restore cycle for external entries. Calling `trash` / `restore` on an external id throws.
- **External entries allow explicit user edits**: `write` / `writeIfUnchanged` / `createWriteStream` / `rename` take effect on external (delegated to ops' atomic write / fs.rename), triggered by explicit user action. Cherry does **not** perform automatic / watcher-driven external file modifications
- **`permanentDelete` on external is entry-level, not file-level**: removes only the DB row + CASCADE-cleans `file_ref`; the physical file is left untouched. Path-level deletion remains available via `ops.remove(path)` (reached through a `FilePathHandle`), which is a separate explicit call not bound to any entry id.
- **Cherry does not track rename/move of external files**: an external rename turns the entry dangling; the user must re-@ to establish a new reference
- **External entry DB row carries no `size`**: `size` is `null` on every external row by design (enforced by `fe_size_internal_only` CHECK). `name` / `ext` are pure projections of `externalPath` and do not drift. Live `size` / `mtime` are served by File IPC `getMetadata(id)` via `fs.stat`; DataApi never exposes them.
- **Dangling state exposed via DanglingCache + File IPC query methods** (`getDanglingState` / `batchGetDanglingStates`); never exposed via DataApi: not persisted to DB; watcher events + cold-path stat push updates
- **Physical paths are not persisted**: internal is derived from `application.getPath('files', ...)`; external is read from the `externalPath` column
- **FileRef polymorphism has no FK**: `sourceId` points into different business tables and relies on application-layer cleanup + orphan scanning as fallback
- **File Module does not do directory import / bidirectional sync**: business modules implement this with DirectoryWatcher + their own mapping tables
- **File Module does not start any chokidar watcher**: watcher lifecycles are managed by business modules; when created via the factory, DanglingCache is automatically wired

## 9. Extension Points

| Extension direction                     | Integration path                                                                                |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AI provider uploads (after SDK stable)  | Add `FileUploadService` + `file_upload` table; FileEntry structure unchanged; migrate via additive migration |
| New business reference source           | Add `sourceType` enum value + register `SourceTypeChecker` (compile-time enforced)              |
| Business module needs to watch external dir | Obtain an instance via `createDirectoryWatcher()` factory; subscribe to events; DanglingCache auto-syncs |
| Dangling reactivity (real-time push to renderer) | Currently pull-based via File IPC `getDanglingState` + React Query refresh; future could push state changes over IPC so renderer invalidates presence queries on DanglingCache events |
| Cross-device file sync                  | Out of file_module scope; solved by the application layer or external sync tools (Drive/Dropbox) |
| Full-text search                        | Currently `ops/search.ts` provides ripgrep-based scanning; persistent indexes managed by businesses like Knowledge |
