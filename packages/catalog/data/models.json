      "description": "Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Thinking is a reasoning-first chat model in the Qwen3-Next line that excels by outputting structured 'thinking' traces (Chain-of-Thought) by default.\n\nDesigned for hard, multi-step problems, it is ideal for tasks like math proofs, code synthesis, logic puzzles, and agentic planning. Compared to other Qwen3 variants, it offers greater stability during long reasoning chains and is tuned to follow complex instructions without getting repetitive or off-task.\n\nThis model is perfectly suited for agent frameworks, tool use (function calling), and benchmarks where a step-by-step breakdown is required. It leverages throughput-oriented techniques for fast generation of detailed, procedural outputs.",

Based on Qwen3-32B, its training process lays the foundation for subsequent fine-tuning and reinforcement learning stages by enhancing fundamental abilities such as tool usage, multi-turn interaction, and instruction following. During the fine-tuning phase, the model not only learns eight carefully curated task types and programming scenarios but also innovatively introduces a reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) stage guided by human engineer-annotated “teacher trajectories.” The final agent reinforcement learning phase addresses scalability challenges through multi-level prefix caching, entropy-based trajectory pruning, and efficient architecture.",

It supports multimodal inputs (text, audio, images, video) and a 1 million token context window, suitable for advanced programming, math, and science tasks.\n\nThis means Gemini 2.5 can handle more complex problems in coding, science and math, and support more context-aware agents.",
